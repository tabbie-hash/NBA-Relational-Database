# NBA-Relational-Database
The aim of the project was to design a relational database of the raw NBA data extracted from Kaggle. The tool used is DataGrip Application. 
The file Letter to the Coach displays all the SQL queries performed to analyse the data and the file NBA diagram displays the schematic diagram of the designed relational database.
